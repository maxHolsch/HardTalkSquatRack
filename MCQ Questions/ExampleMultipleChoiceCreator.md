Please help me generate a series of multiple choice questions

Some of them should show presence of a skill
Some should show the abscence of a skill



We want to comprehensively understand how good are people at conversation skills? Understanding what one should and shouldn't do in a conversation

Given the conversational moves below, please generate a series of multiple choice questions for each of the question types

Question types:
- Which best enacts conversation skill X?
- You're given this problem, which conversation skill does it make most sense to use?
- Based on this transcript, which conversation skill is most evident?
- Based on this transcript/recording, which conversation skill is missing?



Would it be interesting to have there be questions on conversational skills not in the list at all?


make sure to have each question's mention of conversation moves be understandable without ever having heard of these moves before. (i.e. each question can stand alone)



the questions I like are 2, 3

make sure that the distribution of responses are random

we want them all to be workplace related

Make sure that they are only related to one of the conversational moves that we work on

Some of them have to be more difficult



The other responses should have something wrong about them, even if at first they seem right

test on just 1 skill
Skill 1:
Distinguishing Facts from Interpretations: The ability to separate what actually happened (observable behaviors) from the story or meaning we assign to those behaviors. This skill helps people step out of reactivity and into clarity.
Example:
Fact: “They spoke over me twice.”
Interpretation: “They don’t respect me.”

Why we selected this skill
It is the core cognitive move in Harvard’s Difficult Conversations framework.
Most conflicts escalate because people mistake interpretations for truth.
It is teachable, measurable, and AI-friendly (model can easily classify and scaffold).
It reliably reduces defensiveness and attribution error — crucial in any difficult conversation.

Skill 2:
Reflective Listening (Paraphrasing + Emotion Acknowledgment): The ability to restate what someone said in a way that shows accuracy, understanding, and emotional attunement. Reflective listening increases psychological safety and reduces conflict escalation.
Example:
“So it sounds like you felt sidelined when the decision was made without you.”


Why we selected this skill
It is the most empirically validated interpersonal skill across mediation, counseling, and negotiation.
It reliably increases trust, empathy, and cooperation.
It is easy for AI to model and evaluate (“Does this paraphrase capture meaning accurately?”).
It encourages users to shift from reacting το understanding.

Skill 3:
Asking Open, Curious Questions: The ability to ask non-leading, exploratory questions that deepen understanding rather than push an agenda. This skill is the behavioral expression of moving from certainty to curiosity.
Example:
“What feels most challenging about this situation for you?”
“Can you say more about what you were hoping would happen?”

Why we selected this skill
It is central to Harvard’s “learning stance.”
Strongly supported by research in negotiation and perspective-taking.
Extremely AI-compatible: models can classify question quality and help users improve.
Simple, safe to practice, and impactful across scenarios.
