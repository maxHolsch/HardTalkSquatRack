| Question ID | Correct Answer | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | A | A states only what observably happened. B assumes negative intent based on a pattern that may not exist. C attributes a psychological motive. D assumes urgency and confidentiality without evidence. |
| Q2 | A | A describes the behavior and acknowledges uncertainty. B, C, and D all assign motives without evidence—boredom, deprioritization, and passive-aggression respectively. |
| Q3 | B | B describes the observable action. A, C, and D all assume negative intent—getting in trouble, distrust, and exposing mistakes. |
| Q4 | D | D states the fact and acknowledges the limits of knowledge. A assumes substandard work. B assumes disrespect. C assumes positive favoritism. All three interpretations could be wrong. |
| Q5 | A | A quotes the actual words and seeks specifics. B escalates to character judgment. C assumes strategic negative intent. D deflects to a justification rather than staying with what was said. |
| Q6 | C | C states the specific facts and invites exploration. A assumes disrespect. B jumps to commitment judgment. D assumes a manipulative pattern. |
| Q7 | B | B describes what happened and acknowledges uncertainty. A, C, and D all project motives—threat, polite dismissal, hidden favoritism—without evidence. |
| Q8 | B | B states facts and acknowledges unknown factors. A assumes what the manager values. C assumes favoritism and personal dislike. D assumes a judgment about leadership potential. |
| Q9 | A | A stays with the actual words and seeks clarification. B assumes distrust. C assumes insincerity. D assumes hidden negative judgment. |
| Q10 | C | C describes what happened and acknowledges uncertainty about intent. A and B assume deliberate credit-taking. D assumes a value judgment about types of work. |
| Q11 | C | "Attitude problem" is an interpretation. Before any conversation, separating specific behaviors from the label prevents accusation and enables productive dialogue. A, B, and D are valuable but come after clarifying what you actually observed. |
| Q12 | C | The email is neutral, but anxiety is creating an interpretation of threat. Separating the actual words from the story reduces fight-or-flight reactivity. |
| Q13 | C | "Doesn't take us seriously" and "undermines" are interpretations. Getting to concrete behaviors creates something actionable to address. |
| Q14 | C | "Dishonest" is a character judgment/interpretation. Identifying the specific statements or discrepancies creates a factual foundation for the conversation. |
| Q15 | B | "Feeling dismissed" may be layered on top of words that could be interpreted differently. Separating the actual message from the interpretation prevents escalation. |
| Q16 | B | The manager explicitly separates observable data from interpretations before deciding what to address. |
| Q17 | B | The project lead explicitly names the observable events (three changes after sign-off) versus the interpretation (disrespect) and acknowledges uncertainty. |
| Q18 | C | HR is helping the employee move from the interpretation ("targeting") to the specific observable facts (night shift assignments). |
| Q19 | B | The consultant explicitly separates what the client said from the interpretation of incompetence/termination. |
| Q20 | B | The coach moves from the loaded interpretation ("threw you under the bus") to the observable events (what was said, people looking). |
| Q21 | B | "Checked out," "never liked me," "too defensive," and "sabotaging" are all interpretations treated as facts. Neither party identifies specific behaviors. |
| Q22 | C | "Always exclude," "paranoid," "dismissing," and "like this" are all characterizations and generalizations. Neither party cites specific observable instances. |
| Q23 | C | "Never approve anything innovative," "definitely attack," "hates taking risks," and "hostility" are interpretations and predictions treated as facts. |
| Q24 | B | "Completely uncooperative," "refusal to prioritize," and "fundamental lack of respect" are interpretations. No specific observable incidents are cited. |
| Q25 | B | "Not committed," "obviously prioritizing," and "loyalty" are all interpretations. Neither partner identifies specific behaviors that led to these conclusions. |
| Q26 | C | C paraphrases the situation (heavy load, no raise) and names the likely emotional impact. A deflects with context. B jumps to solutions. D minimizes by comparing to others. |
| Q27 | C | C reflects the content (effort, outcome) and emotional experience (frustrating, unfair). A introduces doubt. B jumps to action. D dismisses the emotional impact. |
| Q28 | A | A paraphrases (hitting walls on initiatives) and names the emotional state (demoralized, not valued). B normalizes dismissively. C offers unsolicited advice. D defends leadership. |
| Q29 | A | A captures the sequence (flagged issue, overruled, taking blame) and the emotional dimension (unfair). B seeks information. C advises. D jokes dismissively. |
| Q30 | B | B paraphrases (left out, informed after) and names the emotional impact (isolating). A jumps to solutions. C offers an excuse. D seeks specifics before acknowledging the experience. |
| Q31 | D | D reflects both elements (loved work, struggled with inconsistency) and names the emotional toll. A is bureaucratic. B and C seek details before acknowledging the experience. |
| Q32 | B | B reflects the experience (repeated raising, promises, no resolution) and acknowledges the emotional impact. A jumps to action. C explains/defends. D is too brief and dismissive. |
| Q33 | C | C paraphrases the pattern and names the emotional and social dimension (feels gendered, treated differently). A jumps to solutions. B dismisses the concern. D defends the behavior. |
| Q34 | A | A reflects back what the manager observed and the implicit concern. B deflects. C explains. D becomes defensive. |
| Q35 | B | When someone is emotionally activated, reflective listening creates safety. Questions and problem-solving come after they feel heard. |
| Q36 | C | The employee is expressing demoralization. Acknowledging that before continuing with feedback maintains connection and increases receptivity. |
| Q37 | C | When someone is venting, they're seeking to be heard, not problem-solved or redirected. |
| Q38 | C | The vendor feels dismissed. Acknowledging their emotional state de-escalates and creates space for productive dialogue. |
| Q39 | A | Reflecting back before responding increases the likelihood that they'll actually hear your explanation. Explaining first creates the sense of not being heard. |
| Q40 | B | When someone makes themselves vulnerable, reflecting back creates safety and encourages continued openness. Solutions and resources can come later. |
| Q41 | B | The manager paraphrases the content and names the emotional reality (stressful position). |
| Q42 | B | The consultant reflects the experience (flagging issues, losing trust) and validates the concern. |
| Q43 | B | HR paraphrases the situation (ideas dismissed or credited elsewhere) and names the emotional experience (unrecognized, unseen). |
| Q44 | C | The senior paraphrases (questions not welcome, hesitant to speak up) and names the emotional dimension (isolating). |
| Q45 | B | The mentor reflects the content (hard work vs. what's needed) and names the emotional experience (confusing, unfair). |
| Q46 | B | The manager jumps to logistics without first acknowledging the burnout and exhaustion. The employee may feel unheard. |
| Q47 | C | Beth offers minimization and advice without acknowledging what Amir sacrificed and how destabilizing the news might be. |
| Q48 | A | The director dismisses the employee's self-perception without reflecting back their experience. This misses an opportunity to understand how the employee sees their own work. |
| Q49 | B | The manager offers a perfunctory "I understand" but immediately returns to performance. The employee just shared significant personal context that deserves more acknowledgment. |
| Q50 | A | HR treats the feedback as data to collect rather than an experience to acknowledge. The employee shared disconnection from leadership; that warrants reflection before moving on. |
| Q51 | C | C is open and exploratory. A embeds advice. B assumes a cause. D implies they haven't thought it through. |
| Q52 | A | A invites them to share their actual concerns. B pressures. C pushes a perspective. D limits options to two possibilities. |
| Q53 | A | A invites them to share what they need. B is accusatory. C limits exploration to two options. D is a plea, not a question. |
| Q54 | D | D is open and non-leading. A assumes a cause. B is accusatory ("being so quiet"). C dismisses their reaction. |
| Q55 | A | A invites specific examples. B challenges credibility. C implies poor communication on their part. D implies they're the problem. |
| Q56 | A | A invites them to envision what they want. B and C offer solutions. D limits exploration to two causes. |
| Q57 | C | C is neutral and exploratory. A limits to two causes. B and D are accusatory about past behavior. |
| Q58 | B | B invites them to share their experience without judgment. A pushes acceptance. C labels them as defensive. D assumes they lack awareness. |
| Q59 | B | B is genuinely curious and respectful. A implies they didn't consider impact. C asserts your view as fact. D challenges their competence. |
| Q60 | C | C names an observation and invites sharing without assumption. A implies something is "wrong." B assumes job searching. D forces a binary. |
| Q61 | A | A invites them to share what they need. B implies they're being unreasonable. C appeals to trust (manipulative). D is accusatory about past behavior. |
| Q62 | A | A invites elaboration on process. B and D are yes/no. C assumes the job "didn't work out" and may trigger defensiveness. |
| Q63 | B | Open questions help you understand what's beneath the surface position. Reflective listening confirms you've heard their stated position, but questions reveal what's underneath. |
| Q64 | C | An open question like "What's been the hardest part of your week?" invites sharing more than "Are you okay?" does. |
| Q65 | B | After feeling heard, people are more receptive to exploration. Curious questions deepen thinking without imposing your view. |
| Q66 | C | Open questions help you discover their actual experience rather than test your assumptions (which may prime their answer). |
| Q67 | B | Open questions help them articulate what's unclear to them. Explaining the policy or deferring doesn't help you understand their concern. |
| Q68 | B | "What aspects feel most daunting" is open and invites exploration. |
| Q69 | C | The question invites the client to articulate what they actually want. |
| Q70 | B | The question invites articulation of what's wanted rather than just what's wrong. |
| Q71 | B | The questions help the employee articulate what "clear path" actually means to them. |
| Q72 | C | The question invites specific exploration of what didn't work. |
| Q73 | B | The manager dismisses the concern without exploring it. An open question would reveal what's actually concerning the employee. |
| Q74 | B | The mentor jumps to advice without exploring why now, what they're hoping for, or whether they have concerns. |
| Q75 | B | The agent jumps to action without understanding what actually happened. "Can you tell me what happened?" would be more effective. |
| Q76 | B | The manager diagnosed and prescribed without exploring why the reviews take the time they do. Curiosity might reveal important context. |
| Q77 | B | Without understanding what didn't work before, the salesperson can't effectively position their solution. Curiosity before persuasion. |
| Q78 | B | The interviewer misses the opportunity to explore how the candidate thinks about failure, what they learned, or how they've changed. Moving on immediately signals checking boxes rather than genuine curiosity. |
| Q79 | A | A states the observable facts and explicitly acknowledges the limits of interpretation. B and C both assign meaning (too busy / presentation was strong). D is a reasonable action step but includes the interpretation that the feedback was inadequate and that something "could be stronger"—an assumption. |
| Q80 | A | A describes the observation and acknowledges multiple possible meanings. B assumes negative concern. C assumes positive importance. D assumes inadequate preparation. All three alternatives treat one interpretation as fact. |
| Q81 | A | A notes the observation and explicitly names an alternative explanation without committing to it. B skips interpretation but assumes action is needed. C assumes disinterest. D assumes positive complexity. A is the only one that stays genuinely open. |
| Q82 | A | A describes facts and explicitly acknowledges competing explanations. B assumes passive rejection. C assumes it "fell off her radar" (interpretation) and prescribes action. D is close but "without assuming the worst" implies other options are bad—still attaching meaning. |
| Q83 | B | B states facts and explicitly acknowledges unknown factors. A assumes deprioritization. C assumes poor perception. D is reasonable but doesn't actually separate fact from interpretation—it defers interpretation rather than modeling the skill. |
| Q84 | C | This is tricky because A seems like the natural next step. However, the question tests whether you recognize that "undermining" is still an interpretation even after identifying incidents. The skill of separating facts from interpretations includes checking whether you've constructed a narrative pattern from events that might not actually be connected. C deepens the application of Skill 1 before moving to Skill 3. |
| Q85 | C | "Convinced your manager doesn't see you as leadership material" is an interpretation based on three data points. Before asking questions (A) or preparing to listen (B) or expressing feelings (D), you need to examine whether your interpretation is warranted or whether you're connecting dots that might not be connected. |
| Q86 | D | They've provided incidents (facts), but "passive-aggressive" and "controlling" are still interpretations of those incidents. Before perspective-taking (A), validation (B), or exploring needs (C), they need to examine whether their characterization of the other's intent is warranted by the evidence. |
| Q87 | C | This is tricky because A, B, and D all seem partially correct. But the core skill demonstrated is unpacking the interpretation ("don't trust my analysis") by examining the actual events. This is Skill 1, not positive reframing (which would be replacing one interpretation with another) or resilience-building (which is emotional, not analytical). |
| Q88 | B | A, C, and D might be secondary effects, but the core skill is explicitly distinguishing observable events from an interpretation ("sabotage") that assumes intent. The team lead names this explicitly. |
| Q89 | B | The coach's response isn't bad—it acknowledges friction and asks a forward-looking question. But the coach accepts the interpretation ("obviously threatened") without helping the executive examine it. "Contradicts me," "questions my numbers," and "went to the CEO" could have many explanations besides being threatened. The most important missing skill is helping unpack that assumption. |
| Q90 | B | The director's move to "focus on solutions" might seem constructive, but it skips over the fact that everyone is operating from interpretations ("dropped the ball," "always overcomplicates," "kept changing"). Without separating facts from these characterizations, the same conflict will recur. A, C, and D might help, but the core missing skill is Skill 1. |
| Q91 | A | A reflects all three elements (exhaustion, no relief, guilt) and names the emotional weight without minimizing, solving, or reassuring. B moves to solutions too quickly. C invalidates the guilt ("unnecessary"). D normalizes rather than acknowledging this person's specific experience. |
| Q92 | A | A reflects content (years, sacrifices, uncertainty) and names emotions accurately (destabilizing, scary). B uses "betrayed" which the colleague didn't say—that's interpretation, not reflection. C is too mild and moves to questioning. D uses "slap in the face" which is interpretation and somewhat leading. |
| Q93 | B | B is the only response that reflects all three parts—the experience (contributions taken), the response when raised (told it was sensitivity), and the resulting internal state (questioning judgment). A validates but doesn't reflect. C normalizes ("anyone") rather than staying with this person. D moves to evidence-gathering. |
| Q94 | B | B reflects the situation (structured life around remote, now reversed) and validates the emotional response (disruption, misled) while staying close to their words. A introduces "betrayed" which is stronger than "lied to." C is too mild and jumps to problem-solving. D validates but moves to action. |
| Q95 | D | When someone is emotionally activated, they can't absorb information or engage in analysis. Reflective listening comes before explaining (A), questioning (B), or reframing (C). Once they feel heard, they'll be more receptive to context. |
| Q96 | D | The first party's frustration ("explained three times, they don't get it") suggests they don't feel heard. Reflecting back to them may reduce their intensity. B is tempting but speaks for the second party. A might feel like taking sides. C is useful but doesn't address the emotional escalation. |
| Q97 | C | A deep emotional response has surfaced. Continuing with the performance conversation—even to clarify, support, or reframe—dismisses this moment. Reflecting back ("You've sacrificed a lot for this role and it feels like it's not working despite your effort—that's painful") creates space before continuing. |
| Q98 | B | A is close but too general. The specific skill is paraphrasing content (confident, positive signals, didn't happen, no clear answers) AND naming the emotion (second-guessing, painful). C and D aren't happening here. |
| Q99 | B | The account manager paraphrases the concern (raise concerns, get explanations instead of solutions) and names the emotional impact (feeling unheard). A is an outcome, not the skill itself. C isn't happening—there's no accountability statement. D isn't happening either—there's no question. |
| Q100 | B | The manager's response isn't wrong—resources are helpful. But moving immediately to EAP and FMLA skips acknowledgment of the moment. A simple "That's really hard. Your mom is lucky to have you nearby, and I can only imagine how much you're holding right now" before resources would demonstrate reflective listening. A, C, and D are less central than the missing acknowledgment. |
| Q101 | B | The team lead moves to process improvement without acknowledging what happened to this specific person. The team member shared a painful experience of having been right, being ignored, and then being held responsible. Reflecting that back before discussing lessons learned would address the emotional dimension. |
| Q102 | A | A is open and invites them to name what's changed. B limits to two options. C moves to solutions. D dismisses the concern with a rhetorical question. |
| Q103 | D | D is genuinely open—it doesn't assume it's about the other company (A), compensation (B), or that they want to stay if things change (C). It invites them to share whatever is actually driving the consideration. |
| Q104 | B | B invites specific recollection without limiting or assigning blame. A limits to two options. C jumps to solutions. D seeks blame assignment. |
| Q105 | B | B invites the manager to share their thinking process without implying they missed something (C) or that their mind should be changed (D). A is okay but vague—B gives them something specific to respond to while remaining open. |
| Q106 | C | C is most open—it asks about their internal experience without limiting options. A is good but assumes they want to feel "confident" about "this approach." B limits to two options. D assumes data is the issue. |
| Q107 | C | Generic answers often come from prepared scripts. Follow-up questions like "Tell me more about the decision-making process in that moment" or "What was the hardest part of that for you personally?" require genuine reflection. |
| Q108 | B | Sometimes direct meta-conversation is more effective than continued questioning. B names what's happening without accusation and opens space for whatever is being held back. |
| Q109 | A | After interests are explored and confirmed, the next productive area is constraints—what's blocking movement even when interests are understood. This requires curious questions about what's making agreement difficult. |
| Q110 | C | The questions are genuinely curious—they seek to understand the "why" and the definition of success. A is too adversarial. B is too operational. D is too political. C captures the skill precisely. |
| Q111 | B | The question invites imagination and exploration of what "manageable" would look like. A and D are potential outcomes, not the skill. C isn't quite right—the manager isn't reframing; they're inviting the employee to explore. |
| Q112 | B | The mentor immediately shares their own experience and gives advice. Before that, curious questions—"What draws you to management when you're leaning that way? What pulls you back to technical?"—would help the mentee explore their own thinking rather than adopting the mentor's frame. |
| Q113 | B | The manager validates and commits to think about it, but doesn't explore what the employee has seen or what they think is causing it. "Tension" is vague—curiosity would reveal specifics that inform better action. |
| Q114 | B | The CEO jumps from symptom to solution without exploring what's causing the decline. "Why do you think pipeline is down?" or "What are you seeing in the market?" would enable a more informed response. C is related but the concrete skill needed is questioning, not internal analysis. |
