B) Prepare to reflect back what they say to show you're listening

C) Identify specific things they've done versus the label "inconsiderate" you've applied

A) Plan how to express your hurt using "I" statements

B) Prepare questions to understand what they were thinking

C) Separate the specific joke from your conclusion about respect

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q13.** You and your sibling have been in a cold conflict for weeks. You're convinced "they always have to be right." Before attempting to repair, what's the most important first step?

A) Reflect on your own contribution to the conflict

B) Plan how to acknowledge their perspective

C) Examine specific interactions and whether "always has to be right" is a characterization you're making

D) Decide what outcome you want from the conversation

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

A) Document the instances so you have evidence

B) Plan how to propose a more consistent schedule

C) Examine the specific instances and what you actually know about why changes were made

D) Prepare to validate their challenges while also asserting your needs

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q15.** Two friends in your social circle are feuding and each has told you the other is "toxic." Before taking sides, what skill would be most valuable to apply?

A) Reflective listening to understand each friend's pain

B) Asking each friend curious questions about what happened

C) Helping each friend identify specific incidents versus the characterization "toxic"

D) Staying neutral and not getting involved

**Difficulty: Hard**

---

---

**Q16.** *Context: A person processing conflict with their partner, talking to a friend:*

*"I keep saying he 'shut me down' in that conversation. But what actually happened was he said 'can we talk about this tomorrow?' That's it. The 'shut me down' story is something I added. Maybe he really was just tired."*

**Difficulty: Easy**

---

*Adult child: "She always criticizes my parenting."*

*Mediator: "That sounds really painful. Can you help me understand—what specifically has she said or done that led to that feeling?"*

A) Expressing feelings more clearly

B) Moving from a characterization ("always criticizes") to specific observable events

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q18.** *Context: A person journaling after a difficult interaction:*

*"I need to slow down. What actually happened: Mom asked when I'm going to 'settle down.' What I'm making it mean: She thinks I'm failing at life and she's disappointed in me. But she didn't say that. She asked a question. I'm adding the rest."*

Which skill is evident in this journal entry?

A) Processing emotions through writing

B) Distinguishing the actual words from the meaning being assigned to them

C) Preparing a response to her mother

*Neighbor B: "Okay, so there was an email and an HOA report. The 'trying to control everything' is your take on those two things?"*

Which skill is Neighbor B helping Neighbor A apply?

A) Calming down before taking action

B) Separating specific actions from a characterization about intent

C) Finding common ground with the Hendersons

D) Documenting incidents for a formal complaint

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: Neighbor B helps move from "trying to control everything" to specific events (email, HOA report) and names the interpretation.*

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q20.** *Context: A couple in therapy:*

*Partner A: "She doesn't prioritize our relationship."*

*Therapist: "That's a big statement. What's happened that's leading you to that conclusion?"*

*Partner A: "She worked late on our anniversary. She forgot to book the restaurant I mentioned. She's been on her phone during dinner three times this week."*

*Therapist: "So we have: working late on the anniversary, the restaurant not being booked, and phone use at dinner. Those are the events. 'Doesn't prioritize our relationship' is the story you're constructing from those events. Does that distinction make sense?"*

Which skill is the therapist teaching?

A) Communication improvement techniques

B) Separating observable incidents from the overarching interpretation

C) How to express needs more effectively

D) Empathy for their partner's perspective

---

**Q21.** *Context: A conversation between longtime friends:*

*Jordan: "You've been so distant lately. You obviously don't care about our friendship anymore."*

B) Both parties separating specific behaviors from the accusations they're making

C) Using "I feel" statements instead of "you" statements

D) Taking a break to calm down

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: "Distant," "don't care," "selfish," and "only call when you need something" are all interpretations. Neither identifies specific behaviors that led to these conclusions.*

**Difficulty: Easy**

---

**Q22.** *Context: A parent-adult child phone call:*

*Parent: "You never visit anymore. You've forgotten about your family."*

*Adult child: "I was there two months ago! You're impossible to please."*

*Parent: "Two months is a long time. Your brother comes every month."*

*Adult child: "There you go again, comparing me to him. You've always favored him."*

Which skill would most help this exchange?

A) Active listening to understand each other's feelings

B) Both parties identifying specific expectations versus characterizations like "impossible to please" and "always favored"

C) The adult child validating the parent's desire for more connection

D) The parent acknowledging the adult child's other responsibilities

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: "Impossible to please" and "always favored" are characterizations. Identifying specific observations and expectations would ground the conversation.*

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q23.** *Context: A group text among friends planning an event:*

*Maya: "Some people need to actually contribute instead of just showing up."*

*Derek: "That's clearly directed at me. You've always had a problem with me."*

A) Conflict resolution techniques

B) Separating specific incidents from generalizations and accusations

*Son-in-law: "Your mother is always undermining my parenting."*

*Spouse: "She's just trying to help. You're being too sensitive."*

*Spouse: "I'm not taking sides. You're being paranoid."*

Which skill would most improve this conversation?

A) The spouse validating the son-in-law's feelings

B) Both parties identifying specific incidents rather than using characterizations like "undermining," "too sensitive," and "paranoid"

C) Setting boundaries with the mother

D) The son-in-law expressing appreciation for his spouse's family

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: "Undermining," "too sensitive," "always take her side," and "paranoid" are all interpretations treated as facts. Specific incidents would ground the discussion.*

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q25.** *Context: A person venting to their therapist before a family gathering:*

*"My aunt is going to make passive-aggressive comments about my weight, my uncle will definitely bring up politics to start a fight, and my cousins will ignore me like they always do. It's going to be miserable."*

A) Planning responses to anticipated difficult moments

B) Examining which predictions are based on specific past events versus patterns assumed to continue

C) Setting intentions for how they want to show up

Which response best demonstrates reflective listening?

B) "You're carrying your mom's care by yourself with no support from your siblings, and it's left you exhausted and isolated. That's so much to hold alone."

D) "I get it—family dynamics are hard. My sister never helps either."

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: B paraphrases the situation (sole caregiver, no sibling help) and names the emotional experience (exhausted, isolated). A gives advice. C minimizes. D redirects to own experience.*

**Difficulty: Easy**

---

A) "I don't always get defensive—what about last week when I listened the whole time?"

B) "You feel like when you share something difficult, I react in a way that shuts things down, and now you're questioning whether it's even worth trying. That sounds really lonely."

C) "I'm sorry you feel that way. I'll try to do better."

D) "Why didn't you bring this up before it got to this point?"

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

B) "You're telling me that when I offer advice without being asked, it lands as a vote of no confidence in you—like I don't trust you to figure things out yourself."

D) "What kind of support would you like from me instead?"

**Answer: B**

D) "You should write to the board about how this was handled."

**Difficulty: Medium**

---

**Q32.** A friend going through a breakup says: "I keep thinking about all the time I invested. Six years. And now I have to start completely over. I'm 34."

---

**Q33.** Your parent says: "I used to be able to do everything myself. Now I need help with things I've done my whole life. It's humiliating."

Which response best demonstrates reflective listening?

A) "You've always been so independent, and needing help with things you used to handle easily—that's a real blow to your sense of self. Humiliating is a strong word, and it sounds like it's exactly right."

B) "It's normal to need more help as we age. There's no shame in it."

C) "We're happy to help. Just let us know what you need."

D) "You can still do so much on your own. Focus on what you can do."

**Answer: A**

**Difficulty: Hard**

---

A) Validating that college isn't for everyone

B) Asking open questions about what's behind the resistance

C) Explaining the benefits of college

## Extra-Hard Questions (Mixed Skills)

---

**Q76.** Your best friend says: "I feel like ever since you got promoted, you don't have time for me. I'm happy for you, but I also feel abandoned."

Which response best demonstrates restating their message while acknowledging their emotional experience?

A) "You're noticing we have less time together since my promotion, and you're holding two things at once—genuine happiness for me and feeling left behind. That's complicated."

B) "I'm sorry you feel abandoned. I've just been so busy. Let's schedule something soon."

C) "You're feeling left out since my promotion. I'll try to be better about making time."

D) "It sounds like you feel abandoned. Why didn't you say something sooner?"

**Answer: A**

*Rationale: A is the only response that reflects both elements (happy for you AND abandoned) and names the complexity. B apologizes and jumps to solutions. C reflects partially and commits to action. D asks a question that implies fault.*

**Difficulty: Extra Hard**

---

**Q77.** Your parent says: "I don't understand why you can't just visit more often. Your brother manages to come by every week."

Before responding, which approach would be most useful?

A) Explain your schedule constraints and competing demands

B) Reflect back what they're experiencing before addressing the comparison

C) Ask open questions about what visiting more often would mean to them

D) Separate the fact (your brother visits weekly, you don't) from the interpretation (you "can't" or don't care to)

**Answer: D**

*Rationale: This is tricky. The parent is making a comparison that contains an implicit interpretation (that you could visit more if you prioritized it). Before reflecting, asking questions, or explaining, understanding the interpretation embedded in "can't just visit" helps you respond to what's actually being communicated.*

**Difficulty: Extra Hard**

---

**Q78.** A member of your community group says: "I feel like the leadership doesn't care about members who've been here a long time. All the attention goes to new people."

Which response best demonstrates reflective listening?

A) "That's not true—we just honored long-term members last month."

B) "You're feeling like your tenure here isn't valued, and that the newcomers get attention that you don't. After being here a long time, that invisibility stings."

C) "You're feeling undervalued compared to new members. What would make you feel more appreciated?"

D) "It sounds like you feel overlooked. I can bring that feedback to the leadership team."

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: B reflects content (tenure not valued, new members get attention) and names emotion (invisibility, stings). A defends. C moves to solutions too fast. D is supportive but brief and jumps to action.*

**Difficulty: Extra Hard**

---

**Q79.** Your partner says: "You always put your friends before me." You want to respond skillfully. What should you do first?

A) Reflect back that they're feeling deprioritized compared to your friends

B) Ask for specific examples of when they felt put second

C) Explain that "always" isn't accurate and cite counter-examples

D) Examine whether they've given you specific observations or if "always put your friends first" is a characterization to explore

**Answer: D**

*Rationale: This is extra hard because A and B both seem right. But "always put your friends before me" is a sweeping characterization. Before reflecting or asking for examples, pausing to recognize this as an interpretation (and inviting them to ground it in specifics) applies Skill 1 before Skills 2 or 3.*

**Difficulty: Extra Hard**

---

**Q80.** Your adult sibling says: "You were always Mom's favorite. You have no idea what it was like for me growing up."

Which response best demonstrates separating facts from interpretations?

A) "That's not true. Mom was hard on me too."

B) "I hear you saying you experienced our childhood very differently than I did, and that from your perspective, there was favoritism. I'd like to understand more about what that was like for you."

C) "You're carrying a lot of pain from growing up, and it sounds like you felt unseen. That must have been really lonely."

D) "What specifically happened that makes you feel I was the favorite?"

**Answer: B**

*Rationale: This is tricky. C is good reflective listening. D is a good open question. But B does something specific: it separates what they said ("from your perspective, there was favoritism") from accepting it as fact, while still validating their experience. It demonstrates Skill 1 while remaining relational.*
